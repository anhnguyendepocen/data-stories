 https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/useR-international-R-User-conference/useR2016/Towards-a-grammar-of-interactive-graphics

 From Hadley:
  - models are fundamentally computational, the computer does it for you and that means that they scale
  - every model has to make assumptions, and a model by its very nature cannot question those assumptions
  - models can never fundamentally surprise you because they cannot question their own assumptions, but they do scale.
