#### Project Outline (due Friday Nov 17, 5pm)

This assignment will be worth 25 points  and will count towards the homework component of your final grade.

As a group, you will turn in a 1 paragraph summary of your proposed dataset. This brief description should describe why the group chose the dataset, and what overarching aspects and features of the dataset you all will be focusing on. What story are you going to tell with this dataset? This will be worth 10 points and all group members will receive the same grade for this portion.

Each individual must also add a few sentence summary of their project topic (5 points). This summary must include a tabular or graphical representation of the data that you plan on using for your individual component (10 points). 

It is critical that you start working soon with the dataset, and including the data summary will help you identify possible problems with your question or data early on. In past years students who have started late on the project have not identified critical problems or shortcomings until late in the process when it is hard to change and redirect efforts.

Please upload a single document (Word, Google Doc, or PDF file) that contains the group summary and all of the individual summaries. This file should be placed into the group Google Drive folder.
