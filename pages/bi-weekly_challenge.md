These are short assignments designed to help you get more comfortable with using R, while also challenging you in the language. They are meant to increase your ability to find solutions on your own and also increase communication between you and your peers, TAs, and instructor.

Bi-Weekly Challenges will be posted on the **schedule** page (abbreviated *BC*) one week before the due date. Challenges will be due every other Friday at 7pm submitted as an html file to the studentâ€™s google drive folder. Submissions will be assessed over the following week.

There will be a total of 5 challenges, each worth a total of 20 points. Answer keys will be posted after the due date with the breakdown of points. The maximum score will be 100 out of 80 points. Those who successfully complete 4 challenges will receive full credit. Any excess points over 80 will be given as extra credit towards the final homework grade.

_For Example:_  
Homework Grade: 100/140  
Bi-Weekly Challenge Grade: 90/80  

Total Homework Grade: 190/220
