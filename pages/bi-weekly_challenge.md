These are short assignments designed to help you get more comfortable with using R, while also challenging you in the language. They are meant to increase your ability to find solutions on your own and also increase communication between you and your peers, TAs, and instructor.

Bi-Weekly Challenges will be posted on the **schedule** page (abbreviated *BC*) one week before the due date. Challenges will be due every other Friday at 7pm submitted as an html file to the studentâ€™s google drive folder. Submissions will be assessed over the following week.

There will be a total of 4 challenges, each worth a total of 20 points. Answer keys will be posted after the due date with the breakdown of points. The challenges will contribute to your homework grade, however, the denominator for the biweekly challenge portion will be 60 points. This means that you could completely ignore one challenge and not be penalized on your grade. Or you could do all of them, and receive extra credit. 

_For Example:_  
Homework Grade: 100/140  
Bi-Weekly Challenge Grade: 70/60  

Total Homework Grade: 170/200
