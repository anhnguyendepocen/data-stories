Ethical dilemmas:

1. You are working for a large multinational corporation that conducts business online with tens of millions of customers. The company collects data on individual users' patterns of web-browsing. The methods it uses to gather and store data are described clearly in the fine print of the terms of service. Every prospective user must agree to the terms of service as a condition of joining and using the service. You work in the data warehouse for the company, where algorithms are run on the data collected to help target advertisements for clothing, recreational equipment, credit cards, political campaigns, mortgages, loan repayment programs, music, and other goods. What ethical considerations (if any) should govern the company's use of this data for targeted advertising? What are your ethical obligations (if any) as an employee of the company working on this project?

2. You work for a small statistical consulting firm and are working on a project involving a data analysis for a large clinical trial investigating a promising new cancer treatment for a particularly devastating and high-mortality form of cancer. There is a detailed pre-specified analysis plan that has been circulated among the analysis team but has not been published. In analyzing the data, the pre-specified analysis of the overall effect of the treatment reveals a small positive effect, but the result is not statistically significant. After conducting further analyses that were not pre-specified, your co-worker finds a subgroup of participants for whom the treatment showed very high, and statistically significant, effectiveness. The co-worker shares her results with you. How should you and the co-worker handle this information? Should your group report this finding to the clinicians who conducted the study, and if so, how?
